# Case: 2 

## Links:
Please look over the exploratory analysis Jupyter Notebook with this link hosted via NBViewer: 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ramsun/stout-case2/blob/master/exploratory_analysis.ipynb

## Purpose:
In this challenge, we are tasked with performing aggregate analysis and reporting our findings on a website.

## How?:
I used Plotly.js to create a table, which populates with aggregate analysis served from the Flask routes.  In the backend, Flask is performing complex calculations with the help of the analytics package Pandas.  The website was made pretty with CSS and Bootstrapping.  D3.js was used soley for its useful d3.json function to handle API calls.

## Data Sources:
Data was stored in a CSV.  It can be found in the resources folder in a file called casestudy.csv.

## Tools used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook  
Flask  
JavaScript  
Plotly  
D3.js  
HTML  
CSS  
API
